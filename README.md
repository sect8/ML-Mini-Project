# ML Mini Project: Weather Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project implements a weather prediction model using Logistic Regression. The model predicts weather conditions based on input features such as precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and wind speed.

## Required Libraries
To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn Pillow
```

## Project Structure
1. Data Preparation
2. Model Training
3. Model Evaluation
4. Prediction

## Test Inputs
Use these test inputs to evaluate your trained model:

### Test Input 1
- precipitation: 0.0
- temp_max: 25.0
- temp_min: 15.0
- wind: 3.5

### Test Input 2
- precipitation: 0.2
- temp_max: 18.0
- temp_min: 10.0
- wind: 5.0

### Test Input 3
- precipitation: 1.5
- temp_max: 12.0
- temp_min: 5.0
- wind: 8.0
